# 💸 WeSplit – SwiftUI Bill Splitting App

Welcome to **WeSplit**  
This project is a clean, simple, and elegant bill-splitting app that calculates how much each person should pay — including tips.

It was built as part of my SwiftUI learning journey — and it’s just the beginning.

---

## ✨ What I Built

**WeSplit** is a real-time bill calculator where you can:

- 💰 **Enter** the check amount  
- 👥 **Select** the number of people  
- 🎁 **Choose** a tip percentage  
- ✅ **Instantly see** how much each person owes

All wrapped in a user-friendly, responsive form interface — built with native **SwiftUI** components.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with:

- `@State` and `@FocusState` for local state and keyboard management
- `Form` and `NavigationStack` for structured layout
- `Picker` (navigation and segmented styles) for user input
- Computed properties to calculate values dynamically
- Currency formatting using `.format` and locale support
- Keyboard dismissal with `.toolbar` and UX polish
- SwiftUI Previews for rapid UI iteration

> It’s a compact app, but behind it are real skills I’m building for larger and more complex iOS projects.
