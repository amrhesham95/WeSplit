💸 WeSplit – SwiftUI Bill Splitting App
Welcome to WeSplit, my very first SwiftUI application! 🚀
This project is a clean, simple, and elegant bill-splitting app that calculates how much each person should pay, including tips. It was built as part of my SwiftUI learning journey — and it's just the beginning.

✨ What I Built
WeSplit is a bill calculator where you:

💰 Enter the check amount.

👥 Select the number of people.

🎁 Choose the tip percentage.

✅ Instantly see how much each person owes.

All done in a user-friendly form interface, styled with native SwiftUI components — smooth, intuitive, and responsive.

🧠 What I Learned
This project helped me get hands-on experience with:

@State and @FocusState property wrappers

SwiftUI layout system using Form and NavigationStack

Pickers and Segmented Controls

Custom computed properties and live UI updates

Currency formatting using .format and locale support

Keyboard management and UX polish with toolbars

SwiftUI previews for live iteration

It’s a compact app, but behind it are real skills I’m building for larger, more complex iOS projects.
